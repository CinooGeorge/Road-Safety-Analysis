# 🚦 Road Safety Analysis – Data-Driven Solutions for Safer Roads

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes motor vehicle accident trends to provide data-driven solutions for reducing road fatalities.  
The analysis focuses on identifying high-risk periods, borough-specific accident patterns, and vehicle types involved in accidents.  
The findings offer targeted recommendations to improve traffic safety policies, emergency response, and infrastructure planning.

## 📂 Dataset
- **Source:** NYC Motor Vehicle Collision Data  
- **Period Covered:** 2012 – 2024  

### Key Features:
- **BOROUGH** – Geographic location of the incident  
- **VEHICLE TYPE** – Type of vehicle involved  
- **CONTRIBUTING FACTORS** – Causes (e.g., distracted driving, cell phone use)  
- **CRASH TIME** – Time of accident  
- **NUMBER OF FATALITIES** – Fatality count per crash

## 🔍 Key Research Questions
1. How have quarterly trends in motorist fatalities changed over time (2012–2024), and how do external factors influence these trends?  
2. What are the patterns in vehicle types involved in accidents, and how can this guide road safety strategies?  
3. Which boroughs and time periods exhibit the highest fatality rates, and how can targeted interventions reduce risks?  
4. How do contributing vehicle factors correlate with the geographic distribution of incidents?

## 📊 Exploratory Analysis & Findings

### 📈 Quarterly Trends in Fatalities
- Fatalities peaked in 2013, 2017, 2020, and 2022.  
- Q4 consistently shows higher fatalities due to holidays and adverse weather.  
- COVID-19 in 2020 significantly altered traffic patterns.  
- Fatalities declined slightly in 2023–2024, suggesting safety improvements.

### 🚗 Vehicle Type Contribution
- Top Contributors: Sedans (40–50%) and SUVs (20–25%)  
- Moderate: Passenger vehicles (15–20%) and Taxis (5–10%)  
- Lower Impact: Bicycles (≤5%) and other vehicles  

### 🕑 High-Risk Periods
- Peak fatality hours: 1–6 AM and 3–6 PM (highest at 5 AM)  
- High-Fatality Borough: The Bronx  
- Lowest Contribution: Staten Island  

### 📍 Geographic & Contributing Factors
- Southern areas: Higher incidents of "Cell Phone" and "Backing Unsafely" crashes  
- Northern areas: Other contributing factors dominate  
- Common risky behaviors: Distracted driving and unsafe backing

## ✅ Recommendations
- 🚔 Increase law enforcement presence during high-risk hours (1–6 AM, 3–6 PM)  
- 🌆 Allocate resources to high-fatality boroughs like The Bronx  
- 🚦 Stricter speed enforcement and safety checks for sedans and SUVs  
- 🚴 Improve bike lane infrastructure to minimize cycling accidents  
- 📱 Awareness campaigns to combat distracted driving (e.g., cell phone use)  
- ❄️ Special traffic control during Q4 due to holiday travel and weather conditions  
- 📡 Implement real-time traffic monitoring and alert systems for high-risk zones  

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- R / Python – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization  
- Pandas, ggplot2, Matplotlib – Exploratory analysis and visualizations  
- Geospatial Analysis – Mapping high-risk boroughs and factors  

---

## 📌 Conclusion
The analysis highlights seasonal patterns, vehicle-specific risks, and geographic disparities in traffic fatalities.  
The insights derived can guide policy-making, law enforcement strategies, and community awareness programs to reduce accidents and save lives.
